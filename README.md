.clipboard (dot-clipboard)
==========================

# What is it?

*dot-clipboard* monitor your clipboard and runs user-defined scripts based on the clipboard content.

### I am not a child, what is it?

*dot-clipboard* is a nodejs daemon that runs javascript scripts located in `~/.dot-clipboard` each time the clipboard content change.

### Ok... but why?

Believe it or not **we use the clipboard the same way since the 70s**. Yes, we've copy/pasted stuff the same way for 40 years! Well, until now.

</p>

*dot-clipboard* brings the power of automation to a whole new level. Now each time you **copy** something you will be able to automatically trigger anything, depending on your workflow.

### Yeah... but why?

- You share a lot of gif though github, hipchat or skype ? Automatically backup them to your own public gif folder in dropbox when doing so. See [examples/download-gif.js](/examples/download-gif.js).
- Automatically *backup* a youtube/dailymotion video inside a folder just by copying the link.
- Minify links from clipboard on the fly. Change the clipboard content with a minified link\*
- Automatically convert Spotify/Deezer/Grooveshark links to Youtube equivalent\*

### Wow that's awesome! What more does it do?

- automatically load scripts located inside `~/.dot-clipboard`
- automatically reload scripts when changed/renamed
- customizable concurrency per script
- fully-asynchronous scripts : each *clipboard change* events are duplicated for each script, queued, and then consumed asynchronously

# How do I install it?

```
npm install dot-clipboard -g
```

# How do I write my first script?

- Start `dot-clipboard`
- Open `~/.dot-clipboard`, and save the following `myScript.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  /**
   * Method called each time the clipboard content changes
   * @param  {String} data clipboard content
   * @param  {Function} f(err)
   */
  run: function(data, f){
    console.log('My first script got new clipboard data : ', data);
    f();// we're done
  }
};
```

- Dot-clipboard should trigger a desktop notification saying that it loaded the module
- Try to copy something, you should see a new line inside the console, for instance:

```
My first script got new clipboard data : test
```

- You can now edit/rename `myScript.js` and it will be automatically removed/reload inside `dot-clipboard`.

# I don't like `~/.dot-clipboard`, how can I change it?

The scripts localization is customizable with the `DOT_CLIPBOARD_DIR` environment variable.

# I want to help!

Great! Here are some of the most asked features:

- Expose a clipboard write api to scripts. \* this feature is required.
- Multi-platform support (**currently only *OSX* is supported**)
